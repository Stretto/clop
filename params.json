{"name":"CLOP","tagline":"a language for OpenCL OPtimizations","body":"### Overview\r\nCLOP is a domain specific language for separating an\r\nalgorithm from the device specific optimizations that\r\nimprove the performance of the algorithm on the device.  The\r\nCLOP implementation uses the D programming language as its\r\nhost language.  The CLOP  syntax is similar to, but not\r\nrestricted by the syntax of D.  CLOP fragments embedded in\r\nthe application code allow to refer to the objects defined\r\nin the host application.\r\n\r\n```d\r\n// Needleman-Wunsch algorithm implementation.\r\n// Use CLOP to generate OpenCL kernel and API calls.\r\nmixin(compile(q{\r\n  int max3(int a, int b, int c)\r\n  {\r\n    int k = a > b ? a : b;\r\n    return k > c ? k : c;\r\n  }\r\n  Antidiagonal NDRange(r : 1 .. rows, c : 1 .. cols) {\r\n    F[r, c] = max3(F[r - 1, c - 1] + S[r, c],\r\n                   F[r, c - 1] - penalty,\r\n                   F[r - 1, c] - penalty);\r\n  } apply(rectangular_blocking(8, 8))\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-33317519-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
