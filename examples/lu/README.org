* General information
  This program generate two sequences randomly. Please specify your own
  sequences for different uses.  At the current stage, the program only supports
  two sequences with the same length, which must be divisible by 16.

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./bin/nw 2048 10
  2048     // the length of the sequence
  10       // penalty value
#+END_SRC

The dimension of input matrix should be multiple size of block size. 

******Adjustable work group size*****
The kernel has square shape 
RD_WG_SIZE_0 or RD_WG_SIZE_0_0 describe one dimension 
The actually dimension = RD_WG_SIZE_0 * RD_WG_SIZE_0

USAGE:
make clean
make KERNEL_DIM="-DRD_WG_SIZE_0=16"
